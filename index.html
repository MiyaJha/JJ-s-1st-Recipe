    <H3>Ingredients</H3>
    <ul class="items"> <li>1 1/2 cups whole milk</li>
        <li>3/4 cup semisweet chocolate chips, chopped</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups frozen or thawed kataifi, cut into small shreds</li>
        <li>1 (3.9 ounce) package chocolate instant pudding and pie filling (such as Jell-OÂ®)</li>
        <li>1 cup pistachio cream</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons tap water</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped lightly salted pistachios, plus more for garnish</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tablespoons tahini (ground sesame seeds)</li>
        <li>1 quart whole fresh strawberries with tops</li>
        <li>flaky sea salt (optional)</li>
    </ul>
      <h3>Instructions</h3>
      <ol class="directions"><li>Heat milk in a saucepan over low until steaming, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat and whisk in chocolate chips until smooth.</li>
        <li>Pour melted chocolate into a large shallow bowl. Cover with plastic wrap with wrap touching the surface of the chocolate mixture. Freeze until mixture is thickened and chilled, about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>While chocolate mixture chills, melt butter in a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add kataifi and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden brown and crispy, about 6 minutes. Transfer to a bowl; set aside 3 tablespoons for garnish.</li>
        <li>Pour chilled chocolate mixture through a fine-mesh strainer set over a large bowl with instant pudding. Whisk mixture constantly until slightly thickened and pudding mix is dissolved, about 4 minutes. Refrigerate until ready to use.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, stir together pistachio cream and water until smooth. Gently fold in kataifi, pistachios, and tahini until combined.</li>
        <li>Transfer kataifi mixture to a shallow serving bowl; spread in an even layer. Then, top mixture with chocolate pudding in an even layer.</li>
        <li>Garnish with reserved kataifi, pistachios, and flaky salt, if desired. Serve with strawberries.</li>
    </ol>
